# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
This is a ML Project where I have performed data cleaning, EDA, Featue engineering and Data visulaization and tried to find various hidden patterns and trend from the dataset taken from Kaggle. At last I have made ML model to predict price of used cars, based on the analysis made using various machine learning algorithms like Linear regression and Random Forest.
